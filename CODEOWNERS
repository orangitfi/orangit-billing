# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in

# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence

# @global-owner1 and @global-owner2 will be requested for

# review when someone opens a pull request

# Commented to enable the automerging in depandabot
# * @orangit-sami-bister

# The `docs/*` pattern will match files like

# `docs/getting-started.md` but not further nested files like

# `docs/build-app/troubleshooting.md`
