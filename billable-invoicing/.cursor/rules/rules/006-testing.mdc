- Write tests using the pytest framework (avoid using unittest or other test frameworks).
- Mark tests with categories (e.g., `@pytest.mark.unit`, `@pytest.mark.integration`) to group test types.
- Structure test files and functions for readability; use pytest features like fixtures and parametrize as needed.
